# Installation Guide — MBB Management Consultant Skill for Claude

This guide walks you through installing the management consultant skill on Claude. There are two methods depending on which Claude product you're using.

---

## Method 1: Claude Cowork (Desktop App) — Recommended

[Claude Cowork](https://claude.ai) is Anthropic's desktop tool for file and task management. It supports skills natively.

### Step 1: Download the Skill Files

Download this entire repository as a ZIP file:
- Click the green **Code** button at the top of this GitHub page
- Select **Download ZIP**
- Unzip it to a folder on your computer (e.g., `~/claude-skills/management-consultant/`)

### Step 2: Locate Your Claude Skills Folder

In Cowork, skills live in a `.claude/skills/` folder inside your workspace. To find or create it:

1. Open Claude Cowork on your desktop
2. Click **Settings → Workspace**
3. Note your workspace folder path (e.g., `~/Documents/Claude Workspace`)
4. In Finder/Explorer, navigate to that folder
5. Create a folder path: `.claude/skills/management-consultant/`

> **Note**: The `.claude` folder is hidden by default on Mac. Press `Cmd + Shift + .` in Finder to show hidden files.

### Step 3: Copy the Skill Files

Copy the contents of the downloaded `skill/` folder into your `.claude/skills/management-consultant/` folder:

```
Your Workspace/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        └── management-consultant/
            ├── SKILL.md          ← The main skill file
            └── references/       ← All 80+ reference files
                ├── frameworks.md
                ├── case-interview.md
                └── ...
```

### Step 4: Restart Claude Cowork

Close and reopen Claude Cowork. The skill will be automatically detected.

### Step 5: Test It

Start a new conversation and type:
```
Help me structure a profitability analysis using consulting frameworks.
```

Claude should respond as a senior MBB consultant.

---

## Method 2: Claude Code (CLI) — For Developers

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is Anthropic's command-line tool for agentic coding tasks.

### Step 1: Download the Skill

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/management-consultant-claude-skill.git
```

### Step 2: Move to Your Claude Skills Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r management-consultant-claude-skill/skill/ ~/.claude/skills/management-consultant/
```

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/management-consultant/
# Should show: SKILL.md  references/
```

### Step 4: Use It

In any Claude Code session:
```bash
claude "Help me build an issue tree for a market entry decision"
```

The skill will be loaded automatically.

---

## Method 3: Manual Prompting (No Installation Required)

If you just want to try this without installing anything, you can paste the contents of `skill/SKILL.md` directly into a Claude conversation as your opening message.

1. Open `skill/SKILL.md` from this repository
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste it as your first message in a Claude conversation at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
4. Follow with your consulting question

> **Limitation**: This method doesn't automatically load the reference files. For the full experience (especially for specialist topics like due diligence, post-merger integration, or industry verticals), use Method 1 or 2.

---

## Verifying It's Working

The skill is working correctly when Claude:

✅ **Leads with the answer** — not a preamble, not "great question!"
✅ **Structures problems MECE** — mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive branches
✅ **Uses hypothesis-driven language** — "My initial hypothesis is X because..."
✅ **Quantifies claims** — numbers, ranges, benchmarks, not vague assertions
✅ **Applies the Pyramid Principle** — governing thought → supporting arguments → evidence
✅ **Asks good clarifying questions** — context, complication, constraints

If Claude still sounds generic or hedge-everything, try restarting the conversation and explicitly invoking the skill:
```
You are my MBB management consultant. Help me with the following...
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The skill doesn't seem to be loading.**
A: Make sure the folder is named exactly `management-consultant` and is inside `.claude/skills/`. Restart Claude Cowork after copying files.

**Q: Claude is giving generic consulting advice, not specialist depth.**
A: For specialist topics (e.g., post-merger integration, corporate restructuring, GenAI strategy), explicitly ask Claude to reference the relevant deep-dive. Example: *"Using your due diligence reference, walk me through a commercial DD framework."*

**Q: Can I use this with Claude API?**
A: Yes. Include the contents of `SKILL.md` in your system prompt. For reference file content, you'll need to include the relevant reference files in your context as needed.

**Q: Is this compatible with Claude Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku?**
A: Yes, all Claude models. Claude Sonnet 4.5+ and Opus 4 give the richest consulting responses due to their reasoning depth. Haiku works well for quick framework lookups and case math practice.
